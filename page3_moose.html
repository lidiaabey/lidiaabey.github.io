              Moose are one of the northern hemisphere’s largest land mammals
              and the largest members of the deer family. Their coloring ranges
              from brown to a dusky black depending on the animal’s age and the
              time of year, with calves often a light rusty coloring. Moose have
              long legs, the front legs being longer than the back ones. Their
              snout is long and they have a droopy bottom lip and a shoulder
              hump. Under their chin is a flap of skin that is like a bird’s
              wattle. Their tail is short and each foot has two large toes with
              hooves and two smaller toes. They can move fast, even in the wet
              and mud. Their two large toes spread widely apart to stop them
              from sinking.

            <h2>Distribution</h2>
            <p>
              Moose inhabit northern North America. They are found throughout
              Canada, Alaska, the northeastern United States, and right down in
              Colorado in the Rocky Mountains. They are also found in large
              numbers in northern European countries and throughout Russia. Some
              populations of moose (especially in Europe) migrate, however,
              others remain in one area throughout the year. Moose typically
              inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.
              They can also be found near swamps, lakes, rivers, and wetlands,
              in open country in the lowlands and mountains, including farmland,
              if there is a forest nearby.

            <h2>Habitat and Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              Moose are active during the day. They tend to be solitary, the
              strongest bonds developed between mother and calf. Sometimes two
              individuals will feed at the same stream. Herds are usually seen
              during the breeding season but may contain only two adults. A
              moose is able to run at 35 miles per hour (56km/h) and easily
              swims 10 miles. They will rest in shallow water to cool off or to
              escape from biting insects. They rely on their good sense of
              smell, as they have poor eyesight. Often, while eating, moose will
              suddenly stop to listen out for any threats. You can tell if a
              moose might attack when the long hairs on the hump are raised and
              the ears are laid back.

            <h2>Population</h2>
            <h3>Population threats</h3>
            <p>
              Habitat degradation and hunting are the major threats. Calves and
              ill or elderly moose are preyed upon. The main predators are large
              carnivores, including humans, wolves, black bears, and grizzly
              bears. Moose are hunted for meat as well as for sport and as an
              ecotourism activity. They are not listed as endangered or
              threatened on national or global levels, but in Michigan, they are
              listed as a species of special concern.
            </p>
            <h3>Population number</h3>
            <p>
              According to Wikipedia specific moose populations have been
              estimated in such areas: Moose population in North America: in
              Canada - 500,000 to 1,000,000 individuals. In the United States
              around 300,000 individuals. Moose population in Europe and Asia:
              Finland - 115,000 individuals. Norway - 120,000 moose. Latvia -
              21,000 moose. Estonia - 13,260 moose. Poland - 2,800 individuals.
              Czech Republic - 50 moose. Russia - 730, 000 individuals. Sweden -
              Summer population is estimated to be 300,000 - 400,000 moose.
              Around 100,000 are shot each fall. Overall, currently, moose are
              classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List and their
              numbers today are increasing.
            </p>
            <h3>Ecological Niche</h3>
            <p>
              Through browsing, moose have a dramatic effect on plant
              communities and may inhibit the reforestation of pine and spruce
              forests, thus having a possible negative effect on the timber
              industry. Moose are hunted for sport and for meat, including as an
              ecotourism activity.

              Moose are herbivorous animals and they eat birch and aspen twigs,
              sedges, horsetail, roots, grasses, and pond weeds. They eat
              leaves, buds, twigs, and bark from some woody plants, also
              lichens, aquatic plants, and several of the taller herbaceous
              plants that grow on land. Moose are able to forage for aquatic
              plants both under and on the water.

            <h2>Mating Habits</h2>
            <p>
              Moose breed in September and October. The males are polygynous and
              will seek several females to breed with. During this time both
              sexes will call to each other. Males produce heavy grunting sounds
              that can be heard from up to 500 meters away, while females
              produce wail-like sounds. Males will fight for access to females.
              Female moose have an eight-month gestation period, usually bearing
              one calf, or twins if food is plentiful, in May or June. Newborn
              moose have fur with a reddish hue in contrast to the brown
              appearance of an adult. The young are weaned 5 months after birth
              but will stay with the mother until just before the next young are
              born. Moose become reproductively mature when they are 2 years old
              and are fully grown at 4 or 5.

              This species is called a "moose" in North American English, but an
              "elk" in British English. The word "elk" in North American English
              refers to a completely different species of deer, also called the
              wapiti (Cervus canadensis).

          <div>
            <p>
              Male moose have antlers like other members of the deer family and
              females typically select mates based on antler size. Interestingly
              that moose with antlers have more acute hearing than those without
              antlers.

          <div>
            <p>
              After the mating season males drop their antlers to conserve
              energy for the winter. A new set of antlers will then regrow in
              the spring. Antlers take three to five months to fully develop,
              making them one of the fastest-growing animal organs. Birds,
              carnivores, and rodents eat dropped antlers as they are full of
              protein, and moose themselves will eat antler velvet for the
              nutrients.

          <div>
            <p>
              The fur of these animals consists of two layers; the top layer of
              long guard hairs and a soft wooly undercoat. The guard hairs are
              hollow and filled with air for better insulation, which also helps
              moose stay afloat when swimming

            <p>
              Moose lack upper front teeth but have eight sharp incisors on the
              lower jaw. Their upper lip is very sensitive and helps distinguish
              between fresh shoots and harder twigs; it is also prehensile, for
              grasping food. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small
              saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth, or body. For
              larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind
              legs, allowing it to reach branches up to 4.26 meters (14.0 ft) or
              higher above the ground!
